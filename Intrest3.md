# *Formula 1*  
Formula one is another sport I enjoy watching.  
The high speed racing is exciting and the technical side of things is cool to think about.  
The teams have to put together the most aerodynamic car they can and the drivers have to drive that car the best they can to score points.  
This year has been the most exciting in the last few as McLaren and RedBull have been competing all year and its going to be clos coming down to the end of the season.
