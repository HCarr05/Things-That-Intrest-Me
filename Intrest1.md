# *Computers*
**Computers** are one of my biggest intrest areas.   
They are something that has always been around in my life and I enjoy playing on them and seeing what I can do with them.  
Thinking about how they work intrigues me in the fact that they all work base on 1s and 0s and electrical signials are what determines what they do.  
## *GPU*
To me the GPU is my favorite part of the modern computer.  
It basically allows you to see whats going on.  
The GPU is very powerful and is capable of very intense tasks.
