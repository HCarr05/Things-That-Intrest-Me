**#WW2/Any American History** 
The histroy of *WW2* Really intrests me.  
Getting to learn what the men of the war went through and what chalenges they had to overcome has always intrested me.  
A good example of WW2 being displayed is *Band of Brothers*.ðŸª–  
This show is one of the greatest of all time and does really well at showing what the men went through.  
The show shows what each man went through and focuses on how it affected them more than anything.
